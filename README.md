# Example usage of Pytest library

Just me messing around with some basic examples from the Pytest library:
https://docs.pytest.org

## Installation
pip install -U pytest

## Usage
Navigate to the relevant folder and then simply use `pytest`. All files with "test" in their name will be found and executed.
