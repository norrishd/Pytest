# Example usage of Pytest library

Just me messing around with some basic examples from the Pytest library:
https://docs.pytest.org

## Installation
pip install -U pytest

## Usage
Navigate to the relevant folder and then simply enter `pytest`. All files with "test" in their name will be found and executed.

Or to explicitly run test in somefile.py, enter `pytest somefile.py`.

All functions beginner with 'test' in all included files with be executed.
